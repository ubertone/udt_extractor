# Library for Ubertone's binary files

This library provides python scripts for the extraction of data from udt raw binary files (version 5) generated by Ubertone's UB-Lab P, UB-Lab S4, UB-SediFlow and UB-Lab 3C.
For earlier udt versions, please refer to [udt v4 library](https://github.com/ubertone/udt4_extractor)

If you don't want to write your own code, you will love our [online processing and visualisation tool](https://cloud2.ubertone.eu). We can also provide custom data processing on this cloud platform.

For general data about Ubertone's acoustic profiler, see [Ubertone's website](https://www.ubertone.com).


## Dependencies

The scripts are dependent on [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and on the [peacock_uvp_py_api library](https://github.com/ubertone/peacock_uvp_py_api).

copy or link (`ln -s XXX/peacock_uvp`) the *peacock_uvp* folder into the *udt_extractor* folder (or change the *sys.path* in *test.py*) and run `python test.py` to read the content of the *raw_test.udt* 

By default, the amount of data extracted is limited to about 50 MB (to avoid memory overload).
This value can be modified when calling *raw_extract()*.
If you handle big files, you should better rewrite *raw_extract()* code with an optimized approach. 


## User manual

Data format details are given in the [user manual](user-manual-en_udt_extractor_20231107.pdf).

IQ data can also be extracted as :

*(cell 30 of channel for at 1.7 secondes)*
See the [test.py](test.py) code for more details.

Some comments are still in french, sorry for that, we are working on the translation.
